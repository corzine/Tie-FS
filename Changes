Revision history for Perl module Tie::Filesystem.

0.9.0  Sat Jul 24 15:30:48 EDT 2004
	- Prerelease version.

	- This module was originally going to be released in May 1997 as
	  Tie::File, but that name was already claimed years earlier -- even
	  though it was never actually used.  There was no administrative
	  process in place to reclaim an unused name, and eventually another
	  (unrelated) Tie::File module was released.  This module was finally
	  renamed to Tie::Filesystem, which is more appropriate anyhow.
